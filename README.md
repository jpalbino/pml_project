Practical Machine Learning Course Project

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which a group of enthusiasts 
take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health and to find 
patterns in how they do exercises. 
In this report we describe how we built our model, using cross validation, and 
the expected out of sample error.
